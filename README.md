# Requirements
Requires iOS 7 & above.
Require iphone 4s and above
Requires a real device as BLE is not supported by the iOS simulator.
Requires xcode 6 and above

#Instructions to Run:

1)Just clone the repository.
2)Open the xcode project.
3)Connect an iphone to the computer with iOS 7 and above(preferably with iOS 8.3)
4) The project contains a Beacons.json file. Change the details of the beacon for example the UUID, major id and minor id according to the details of your beacons.
5)Build and run. Note to run an ios app on physical device one must have a active apple developer's account or shoud have a jailbroken iphone.
6)After the code has been signed and the app has been installed on the physical device we are good to go. Bring the phone in the region of an iBeacon(estimotes only), and we would see context aware offers on the phone itself.

Incase someone wants to test this app on a physical device just email me the UDID of the iphone at nipun.ahuja572@gmail.com and then this .ipa file would be good to installed on a real physical device. 


#We Guys are coming up with a full tutorial on how to make an Iphone app context aware. Link would soon be posted.
